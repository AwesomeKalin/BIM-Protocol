## Explanation of how BIM works

BIM uses a technology used in Bitcoin called SegWit. In simple terms, SegWit puts signature data outside of the main part of the transaction, to save block space. This allows a higher amount of data to be stored in a block, to be specific 4mb. SegWit also allows any data to be stored in the extra space. This is where BIM information is stored.
